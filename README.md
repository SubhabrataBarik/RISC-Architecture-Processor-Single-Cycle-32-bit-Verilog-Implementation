# RISC-Architecture-Processor-Single-Cycle-32-bit-Verilog-Implementation
Designed a 32-bit single-cycle RISC architecture processor in Verilog
In this project, I Designed and implemented a 32-bit single-cycle RISC architecture processor in Verilog,
integrating various components such as program counters, ALU, instruction memory, data memory, and
a register file.
The processor handles instruction execution, control signal generation, and branching/jumping for a
simple instruction set architecture (ISA). Additional features include SSD display and clock dividers for
performance monitoring.
This implementation demonstrates expertise in hardware design and digital logic, with a focus on real-
time processing and control.
